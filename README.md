# Buy me a coffee Web3 Project

## Project Description
This is a minimalistic web application built with HTML and JavaScript that interacts with a Solidity smart contract. The project demonstrates basic Web3 functionality, allowing users to connect their wallet, interact with the smart contract, and perform simple operations.

**Buy Me a Coffee makes supporting fun and easy.** In just a couple of taps, your fans can make the payment (buy you a coffee) and leave a message.


## Features
The application includes the following features:

1. **Connect**: Allows users to connect their Ethereum wallet using MetaMask.
2. **Buy Coffee**: Sends a transaction to the smart contract to "buy coffee" (a placeholder function in the contract).
3. **Get Balance**: Fetches and displays the current balance of the smart contract.
4. **Withdraw**: Allows the contract owner to withdraw funds from the smart contract.

## Getting Started
To run this project, you need:
- A browser with MetaMask installed.
- A deployed Solidity smart contract that supports the above functions.

## How to Use
1. Open the web application in your browser.
2. Click the **Connect** button to connect your wallet.
3. Use the **Buy Coffee** button to send a transaction to the smart contract.
4. Click **Get Balance** to view the current balance of the contract.
5. If you are the contract owner, use the **Withdraw** button to withdraw funds.
